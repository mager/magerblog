#### Instructions:

Cook the pasta according to package instructions, subtracting 2 min for al dente. Drain and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.

Gradually add the half-and-half, whisking to combine, and cook until the mixture thickens (about 5 minutes).

Stir in the shredded white cheddar and Parmesan cheese, mixing until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth for a few minutes.

Season the sauce with salt, pepper, garlic powder and mustard poweder, if using. Taste and adjust as needed. Combine the cheese sauce with the cooked pasta, mixing well to coat evenly.

Serve hot, optionally garnished with more grated parm.

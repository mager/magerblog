	<p>Hey there, I'm Mager! I'm a software engineer at Uber, where I spend my
      weekdays building delivery APIs. On the weekends, you'll usually find me
      writing some code, exploring new restaurants with my wife and our dog, and
      enjoying a cold hop water. I'm also a proud Chicagoan and love to explore
      the vibrant neighborhoods and hidden gems of this amazing city. If you're
      interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about all
      things code, food, sports, and beer, don't hesitate to reach out on
      [Twitter](https://x.com/mager)! Looking forward to hearing from you.
